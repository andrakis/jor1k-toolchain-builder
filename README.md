jor1k toolchain builder
=======================

These scripts should help to build the experimental toolchain, programs and libraries for the openrisc or1k processor.
The final goal is to build an bootable image with a number of tools available for further development.

Parts are based on the book "Linux from Scratch", "buildroot", and "sabotage linux"
